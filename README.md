# Full-Duplex Steepest Descent
This is a code package related to the follow scientific articles:

Elyes Balti and Brian L. Evans, "[Adaptive Self-Interference Cancellation for Full-Duplex Wireless Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01504)," 2021.

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that reproduces the performance results of the bit error rate (BER) and the spectral efficiency presented in the paper listed above.

# Content of Code Package
This package contains 2 files:

1- "SteepestDescent.m" returns the estimated self-interference channel.

2- "main.m" produces the results of the BER and the spectral efficiency.

See each file for further documentation.
